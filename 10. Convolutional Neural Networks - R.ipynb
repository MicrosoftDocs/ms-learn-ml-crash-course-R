They take a lot of time and practice to properly understand each aspect of them.\n\nHere we used:  \n* __Feature scaling__ - reducing the range of the values. This helps improve training time.\n* __Convolutional layers__ - network layers that pre-process the data for us. These apply filters to extract features for the neural network to analyze.\n* __Pooling layers__ - part of the Convolutional layers. They apply filters to downsample the data - extracting features.\n* __Dropout__ - a regularization technique to help prevent overfitting.\n* __Dense layers__ - neural network layers which perform classification on the features extracted by the convolutional layers and downsampled by the pooling layers.\n* __Softmax__ - an activation function which outputs the probability for each category."
