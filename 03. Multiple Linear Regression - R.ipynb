You should obtain an R² value of 0.1887701, which is also < 0.3, so we should create a better model for our data.\n\nStep 4\n---\n\nThe problem with our chocolate bar survey is that the chocolate bar variables aren't controlled; cost, bar weight, and cocoa percent are different for every chocolate bar.\n\nWe want to see the relationship between cocoa content and customer happiness, but cost and block weight are also influencing customer happiness.\n\nWe *could* run another survey, giving away chocolate bars that are all the same weight for free (i.e. weight and cost are constant), and ask people how happy they are with the chocolate bar given varying percentages of cocoa. However, this would be expensive and time consuming.\n\n__Alternatively, we can use multiple linear regression__. Multiple linear regression gives us the relationship between each _feature_ and customer happiness. These are provided as _coefficients_ (slopes). Positive numbers indicate a positive relationship (i.e. customer happiness increases as this feature increases), negative numbers indicate a negative relationship (customer happiness decreases as this feature increases). Unlike _simple_ linear regression, these relationships should be independent. That means that our relationship between cocoa percentage and customer happiness should not be influenced strongly by bar weight or cost. \n\n#### Change the formula for multiple linear reqression by replacing `<addCostPercentHere>` with `cost` and run the code."

However the coefficient for cost is negative, which means increases in cost decrease customer happiness.\n\nThe R² value (2nd last line of results summary) is also higher than before. This means our multiple linear regression model fits the data better than our simple linear regression models.\n\nStep 5\n---\n\nFrom our linear regression, we have an equation, `lm_choc`, that predicts customer happiness. It looks like so:\n\n`customer_happiness = -9.34 + weight * 0.106 + cocoa_percent * 31.9 + cost * -1.31`\n\nWe might also know that, for our company, the cost of manufacturing and shipping each bar can be calculated as:\n\n`cost = (0.05 * weight + weight * cocoa_percent)^2 * 0.0004`\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the best bar for our customers, by balancing the cost against how happy the customer is likely to be with this product.
